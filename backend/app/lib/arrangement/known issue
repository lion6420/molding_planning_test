Ver.3.3.0)

Basic planning logic:
1. Yesterday delayed order. (The delayed orders are checked offline for now)
   (1) more than one delayed order of one machine are considered.
2. Emergency order
    (1) [Off] Add the urgent mode. In the urgent mode, order insertion is allowed.
    (2) Check the order with the same mold first.
    (3) Emergency part number are ordered in row order.
    (4) A column (maximum mold number) shows the maximum times that this part can be ordered.
3. Normal (By row order in weekly_demand)
4. [Off] Buffer (Add the buffer mode)


Fixed issue in this edit:
1. The end time is not limited.

Known issue:
1. A part number with more than one plastic number.
2. The new testing mold tend to be planned at the same part number.
3. Different part number with same mold, but with different plastic number, change the plastic need another time.
4. Mold data.
5. Package type.
6. The time for mold changing cannot be at the same time.

Fixed issue:
1. One mold two chambers (keep updating).
2. Same part number is ordered two times.
3. Real yesterday manufacture progress. (offline for now)
4. Two different molds working at the same time is allowed (Maximum mold amount is recorded in Emergency data sheet for now)
5. Fixed the machine color filter function(machine.get_machine_by_color()) return the unworked machine.
6. Some of the first orders need the mold changing time.
7. Oversea part number with different package type, but no need mold changing time. (Different part number but same mold)
